Знаете, че Лаванда приключи да работи като ресторант. Благодаря на всички, които не спират да ни търсят, звънят, спомнят си за нас.. Е, софийската ресторант сцена е толкова променлива напоследък и след като вече ни няма, ново място ще заеме нашата локация.. Лаванда обаче остава да живее като наложено име за качество, носещо собствен  стил и красота, създадени с много любов. Основната ни идея ще се промени, но пак ще творим с вдъхновение.
