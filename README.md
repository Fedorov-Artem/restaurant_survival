# restaurant_survival
This project's goal is to check the which restaurants stay in business and which close. To study the question I used two datasets: one from 2021 scraped by STEFANO LEONE and published on kaggle, another dataset was scraped by me as part of the project in 2023. Then the datasets were joined together. To answer the question about the surviving restaurants I've built a ML model, prediction restaurant closure and then checked which features improve model's performance.


This EDA notebook uses data gathered from TripAdvisor in early May 2021 by STEFANO LEONE (link to the original dataset) and also the data I've gathered from TripAdvisor in late August 2023. The main question for the EDA is to see which restaurants from the original dataset are still working and which have closed.

I have gathered data for all the restaurants located in Northern Ireland (part of the UK), Slovakia, Bulgaria and Finland that were mentioned in the original dataset. I decided to choose four countries with the least number of hotels in the original dataset, as it would be time-consuming for me to try to get the data from all the major European countries. Info for some restaurants is no longer available, as TripAdvisor now redirects to the page with the list of all nearby restaurants; these restaurants are now closed. Almost no info is possible to get about them now, so my dataset contains very minimal information about those restaurants, just the fact that they've been removed from TripAdvisor. Other restaurants' pages are still available, but they are marked as closed, with their names having "CLOSED" at the end. It is possible to get most of the information on those restaurants, and this information is present in the new dataset. A few restaurant pages now redirect to the pages of some other restaurant, and some redirect to pages of restaurants outside the country. Those are restaurants that were reported on TripAdvisor twice (duplicates).

In this EDA, I use an already cleaned dataset that contains all the relevant information from both datasets in the same row. The few duplicates mentioned earlier have been removed from the dataset, all the other restaurants are there. The data cleaning notebook is available here.

To check which restaurants have closed and which have survived, we mostly need information from 2021. From 2023 we only need information that help us label the closed restaurants. Unfortunately, not all the restaurants that were actually closed are marked as closed on TripAdvisor. To distinguish between closed and open restaurants, we can use some additional information from 2023, like the date of the last review and information on the availability of restaurant websites.
